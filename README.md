## To execute script 

To run the program, put the code in hello-world.go and use go run.

`$ go run hello-world.go
hello world`

Sometimes weâ€™ll want to build our programs into binaries. We can do this using go build.

`$ go build hello-world.go
$ ls
hello-world    hello-world.go`

We can then execute the built binary directly.

`$ ./hello-world
hello world`

##  To execute test

go test # to run your tests
